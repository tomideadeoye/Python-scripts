I skipped the Nigerian law school for a Technology Management Scholarship at the Nigerian University of Technology and Management (NUTM) - I met Shola Akinlade here, applied to this same role, passed the assessment, did the case study, got to the final stage, and was the ghosted by Paystack. 😢\n",
    "2. That aside, I started a company during the program; the opportunity cost was a year of rest without the stresses of entrepreneurship. The company set out to map property transactions in Nigeria to geospatial data, thus allowing people to check the dimensions of property on a map (like Uber). It would also let consumers make land verification and certification requests from a web app and ultimately allow virtual property transfer.\n",
    "In retrospect, the project failed for several reasons but mostly the disinterest of the government in releasing data on property transactions to us without physical copies of official documents. This meant our growing company, which hadn't raised any funding, would take on more risk than our underlying assets can cover in case of liability (if a document got lost). \n",

    "For example, Dave Chappelle's shows are a mix of humor and an exposition of the challenges faced by Black Americans, while comedians like Rick Gervais and George Carlin openly discuss atheism and explore the rationality of conventional wisdom.\n",
    "Comedy is often only the scenario in which people with fixed mindsets about sensitive subjects such as racism, atheism, gender, sexism, and liberality can explore the viewpoints of others with their guard let down.  \n",

    "I have used web scraping and web automation recently for 3 amazing things:\n",
    "1. I used it to gather all property listings on propertypro.ng and then run a regression model to predict house prices. The results were fairly accurate for predicting property prices in Lagos, which was the primary project use case. \n",
    "2. I scraped all Blockchain posts on https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/ and converted them to a Pandas data frame so I can ask complicated business questions like: \n",

    "- locations of customers, \n",
    "- sales, orders, and expenses of each customer, \n",
    "- top performing referees, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "I found the project particularly exciting because of the data visualization aspects of the project. While I am familiar with writing scripts for cleaning data in python (using pandas), I had to write code in JavaScript to clean the data being sent from the server and put the data in formats supported by libraries like D3 and React Chart.  Additionally, in instances where I could not access Nigeria via D3, I wrote the script rendering the visualizations without leveraging any library.\n",

    "Decentralized Finance!!\n",
    "From a non-technical viewpoint, DeFi is interesting to discuss because of the enormous diversity of opinions about cryptocurrencies in general and DeFi. \n",
    "Many of the DeFi rebuttals focus on crypto's inability to bank the unbanked, I think this is very erroneous. Crypto definitely pulls down a lot of walls in terms of mobility of labor and financial inclusion. While it's true that some good folks here in Africa (myself included) don't have mobile devices or are unable to participate in DeFi, some can!!!\n",
    "There are lots of Africans receiving remittances or paychecks via crypto because of the complexity of traditional means, and these people's spending contributes to their local economy instead of having emigration as the sole option for mobility of labor.\n",
    "Another argument is often the efficiency of centralized systems; that's true in a lot of cases. But there are also innovations in DeFi that can't exist in traditional finance; the composability of DeFi apps comes to mind here - the sheer ease of building an application that interacts with another app. \n",
    "By simply knowing Solidity, I can write scripts that interact with Uniswap, Aave, and more simultaneously. This is, for example, the reason why flash loans exist. I can also write scripts that automate my savings and create investment portfolios designed to my exact specs. Nigerian investment apps like Cowrywise, and Piggevest, for example, merely present limited investable options. Smart Contracts on Ethereum lets me write the scripts and logic that power the investment strategy. \n",
